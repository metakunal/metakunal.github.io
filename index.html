        <p>
          I've been working in tech since i was 15 mostly exploring the then low
          code tools such as blogger and wordpress. After school, I enrolled in
          a bachelors degree from National Institute of Technology, Allahabad. I
          have a constant love for building and breaking things. I've been
          fortunate enough to work with and learn from incredible people around
          the world - and that's seeded a lot of my work and thinking. This
          website is a WIP. I used to write essays a few years back, but now I
          am quite inconsistent. I plan to start writing again, mostly to
          capture a trend of changes in my thinking, but until then, my twitter
          is the best place to catch my thoughts.

        <h4>
          inspired by <a href="https://nat.org">nat</a>, some things i believe:
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Money is a means not the end.
            <ul>
              <li>
                The ultimate purpose of money is to enable you to pursue and
                achieve your broader aspirations and objectives.
              </li>
              <li>So do not sacrifice end for the means.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Where my dreams are neither a conclusion nor an etemal pursuit, but
            conversations - deep intricate dialogues I have with myself.
            Dialogues that question, ponder and cherish <i>'the now'</i>, while
            romanticizing the <i>'what ifs'</i>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not move to complex solutions until you have mastered the
            absolute basics.
          </li>
          <li>Fail fast, kill fast iterate. Speed is intelligence.</li>
          <li>Action produces information.</li>
          <li>In order to break the rules, you must first know the rules.</li>

          <li>
            From where do you get your dopamine matters the most.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Better to get your dopamine from improving your ideas than from
                having them validated.
